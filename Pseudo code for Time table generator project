include reqired header file

Define a structure named Course with the following attributes:
    subjectcode   : string
    totalLectures : integer
    faculty       : string
    isElective    : boolean
    semester      : string
    program       : string
    branch        : string

Define a function named parseCSVLine that takes a string line as input and returns a Course object:
    Initialize a stringstream with the input line
    Initialize an empty vector of strings named tokens
    Split the line by comma and store each part in the tokens vector
    Create a Course object and populate its attributes with values from tokens
    Return the Course object

Define the main function:
    Open a CSV file for input
    If the file fails to open, print an error message and exit the program
    Initialize an empty map named classroomCourses to hold courses grouped by classroom

    Read each line from the file:
        Parse the line using the parseCSVLine function
        Generate a key for the classroom based on program, branch, and semester
        Add the course to the corresponding vector in classroomCourses using the generated key

    Initialize variables maxCore and maxElective to 0

    Iterate over each classroom in classroomCourses:
        Initialize coreCount and electiveCount to 0
        Count the number of core and elective courses in the classroom
        Update maxCore and maxElective if necessary

    Calculate the total number of slots as the sum of maxCore and maxElective

    Print the table header with the classroom names and slot numbers

    Iterate over each classroom in classroomCourses:
        Print the classroom name
        Print the subjectcodes of core courses followed by blank slots
        Print the subjectcodes of elective courses followed by blank slots
