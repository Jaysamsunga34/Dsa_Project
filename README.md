This is our Capstone project for the Data Structures course. We were assigned P-1: Automatic Time table generator.
We have tried to solve this with 2 different approaches, one is to make slots and the other one is to generate the timetable directly.
Most of the work was done on VS code with all group members sitting together. To make the project we have also taken the help of various online sources as a reference to learn and improvise.
Researching and the overall code was worked upon by all the members together. However, talking specifically, Vasu and Vansh focused on the 1st approach while Jayaditya and Hriday worked majorly on the 2nd code.
All the other things like pseudo code, time and space complexiies, output screenshot, data structure used in the code are given in the submitted pdf file.
