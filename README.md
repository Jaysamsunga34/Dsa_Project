Here we make a time table generator system. We do this with 2 different approaches one is to make slots and another is direct generating time table.
Here most of the things are done offline in VS code sitting with all the group members.
But part of code 1 means making slots from given input is done by vasu and vansh & code 2 means generating time table is done by Jayaditya and hriday.
All the other things like pseudo code, time and space complexity, output screenshot, data structure used in the code is given in word file.
